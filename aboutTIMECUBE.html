        <h1>TIMECUBE</h1>
        <a href="index.html" style="font-size: small; background-color: black;">[Go Back]</a>
        <p>TIMECUBE is a tool for visualising <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime">spacetime</a> from a new angle.</p>
        <p><img src="https://github.com/yitzilitt/TIMECUBE/assets/28551587/d8c8f518-1b47-4f67-9999-8a0caa38de6d" alt="image"></p>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The TIMECUBE is intended for artists, philosophers, scientists, film editors, and those who wish to experience <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alterity">alteritization</a> of the peculiar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">dimensionality</a> of our universe.</p>
        <p>Video inputs are TIMECUBIFIED into a 3-dimensional point cloud which allows the pixel/color data of the entire video to be viewed at once. The cloud (or TIMECUBE) can be ‚Äúsliced‚Äù (via TIMEKNIVES) to view and output 2D cross-sections of the TIMECUBE, which can be used to either reconstruct the original video, or to gain an entirely alien perspective of the world.</p>
        <p><img src="https://github.com/yitzilitt/TIMECUBE/assets/28551587/8771885f-6fa2-432a-91f4-222e16418b15" alt="image"></p>
        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <h3>Intorduction</h3>
        <p>Imagine a typical video. Or don‚Äôt. Whatever. I‚Äôll do the work for you:</p>
        <p><img src="https://github.com/yitzilitt/TIMECUBE/assets/28551587/d09146f2-ecdd-423d-8dcf-0406fab99d04" alt="man walking tree bench"></p>
        <p>In this video, we see a man walk from left to right, go behind a tree, and sit down on a bench. The camera, and the scene as a whole, is pretty static. In fact, <em>nothing</em> in this scene is actually moving. Nothing ever truly is on film. In reality, we are simply watching a rapid sequence of still pictures, which when played quickly enough (in this case, 10 frames per second), causes our brain to percieve motion. In a traditional film reel, these pictures are physically connected, one next to the other, and are rapidly moved across a projector:</p>
        <p><img src="https://github.com/yitzilitt/TIMECUBE/assets/28551587/aeeb7dff-180b-4267-bde3-2169eb98838c" alt="timecube example vid film strip (Small)"></p>
        <p>Congrats! You have now visualized the same event in two different ways: once as a series of still images, seperated by time (aka a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù video), and once as a series of still images, seperated by vertical or horizontal space (aka a film strip). No data is lost in converting from one visualization to the other, and both can be helpful in different ways. Videos are useful when trying to ‚Äúspot the difference‚Äù from one frame to the next, while looking at still frames from a video can be helpful in distinguishing details which might otherwise be lost in a blur of motion.</p>
        <p>This is how we normally visualize events, but there are other ways to percieve the world as well.</p>
        <p>In order to create the TIMECUBE, instead of displaying the frames of a video as seperated in time, or along the vertical/horizontal dimension, we display our frames <em>on top of</em> each other, forming a ‚Äúloaf,‚Äù or cubic 3D shape. At the side of our TIMECUBE closest to us, we see the first frame, directly behind that is the second frame, and so on, with the final frame of the original video displayed at the far end:</p>
        <p><img src="https://github.com/yitzilitt/TIMECUBE/assets/28551587/ed576eca-92fd-45f3-9e89-b7c5e5a6ca1a" alt="image"></p>
        <p>(In the above visualization I have removed the lighter pixels from the scene, to make it easier to see the depth of the TIMECUBE.)</p>
        <h1>The TIMEKNIFE</h1>
        <p>An individual frame of a given video is effectivly a cross-section of that video‚Äôs TIMECUBE. To retrieve a frame, we simply SLICE the TIMECUBE with a plane at the proper angle, and ‚Äúpaint‚Äù the plane (or TIMEKNIFE) with the nearest pixel values:</p>
        <p><img src="https://github.com/yitzilitt/TIMECUBE/assets/28551587/2937dbbd-609e-464f-81d8-b539d6d10a62" alt="image"></p>
        <p>If we want to recreate our original video, we can simply slide the TIMEKNIFE back and forth, and record the output:</p>
        <p><img src="https://github.com/yitzilitt/TIMECUBE/assets/28551587/50c4ec2f-5522-4eda-ad7c-81a375dae802" alt="ezgif com-video-to-gif(4)"></p>
        <p>But that isn‚Äôt the only way we can use our TIMEKNIFE. The nice thing about slicing things is that with enough determination, you can slice along any angle that you want! For example‚Ä¶</p>
