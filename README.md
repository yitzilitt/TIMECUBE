## About
The TIMECUBE is intended for artists, philosophers, scientists, film editors, and those who wish to [defamiliarize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamiliarization) themselves with the peculiar [dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) of our universe.

Video inputs are TIMECUBIFIED into a 3-dimensional point cloud which allows the pixel/color data of the entire video to be viewed at once. The cloud (or TIMECUBE) can be "sliced" (via TIMEKNIVES) to view and output 2D cross-sections of the TIMECUBE, which can be used to either reconstruct the original video, or to gain an entirely alien perspective of the world.
