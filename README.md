# TIMECUBE
TIMECUBE is a tool for visualising [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime) from a new angle.

## About
The TIMECUBE is intended for artists, philosophers, scientists, film editors, and those who wish to [defamiliarize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamiliarization) themselves with the peculiar [dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) of our universe.

Video inputs are TIMECUBIFIED into a 3-dimensional point cloud which allows the pixel/color data of the entire video to be viewed at once. The cloud (or TIMECUBE) can be "sliced" (via TIMEKNIVES) to view and output 2D cross-sections of the TIMECUBE, which can be used to either reconstruct the original video, or to gain an entirely alien perspective of the world.

## Explanation
### Intorduction
Imagine a typical video. Or don't. Whatever. I'll do the work for you:

![man walking tree bench](https://github.com/yitzilitt/TIMECUBE/assets/28551587/d09146f2-ecdd-423d-8dcf-0406fab99d04)

In this video, we see a man walk from left to right, go behind a tree, and sit down on a bench. The camera, and the scene as a whole, is pretty static. In fact, *nothing* in this scene is actually moving. Nothing ever truly is on film. In reality, we are simply watching a rapid sequence of still pictures, which when played quickly enough (in this case, 10 frames per second), causes our brain to percieve motion. In a traditional film reel, these pictures are physically connected, one on top of the other, and are rapidly moved across a projector.
